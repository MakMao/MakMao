# Hey there!

My name is Max van Beek and I started my coding journey in the spring of 2021. From the moment I started, I noticed there was a hidden passion for front-end development in me. That resulted in me working fulltime on achieving my goal: becoming a ReactJS developer. During the past 12 months I followed multiple courses and built countless projects. There have been a lot of challenges along the way, however, I am satisfied with the progress up until now. Let's keep on coding and get bettter at it every single day! :)


### :hammer: Tools I use:
- HTML, CSS/SASS
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- ReactJS
- GatsbyJS
- Countless ReactJS libraries
- Bootstrap, Tailwind
- Styled Components


###  :seedling: Currently I'm learning:
- NextJS
